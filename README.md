# Terminal_From_Scratch
This is a project done to know how a terminal works on an operating system and build a small functioning terminal from scratch.
In the very first step you need to save the file in your local computer
Then compile and run the file you saved in your computer's terminal using command(java Main.java / javac Main.java, java Main)
compile-c abc.c / compile-cpp abc.cpp will only work if mingw is installed on your local device.
If open-chrome, open-youtube are not working, check with the paths used in the code. Chrome may be installed on different location on your local computer.
